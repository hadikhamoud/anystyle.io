        <h3>1. Parse</h3>

        <p><em>To get started,</em> simply paste your list of citation references
        into the textarea above. AnyStyle processes one reference per line so
        please make sure each reference starts on a new line and remove any
        superfluous line breaks. Empty lines are fine, though, the parser will
        just skip them.</p>

        <p class="lead">When you're ready, hit the parse button!</p>

      center_html: >-
        <h3>2. Edit</h3>

        <p><em>AnyStyle splits</em> your references into segments (author, title etc.)
        based on machine learning heuristics. These segments will be
        displayed in the token editor above. Please review each segment to
        make sure the results are correct; in case the parser got something
        wrong just <span class="text-selection">select individual tokens
        like you would select text in your favourite text editor</span> and
        click on the <b>Assign label</b> button to assign the correct label to
        your selection.</p>

        <p>Pro tip: use <b>Shift</b> and <b>Ctrl/Command</b> to make multiple
        selections or double-click to select an entire segment at once.</p>

        <p>When using the token editor, note that the parser requires
        every token to be assigned a label and the individual segments to
        be contiguous. For the best results combine tokens which
        semantically belong together. The word <em>in</em>, for example, typically
        belongs to either the <em>editor</em> or <em>container-title</em> segments (in fact it
        is a good indicator for those fields). When in doubt how to label
        a reference, please get in touch with us or take a look at our core
        <a href="%{core_url}">training data</a> for examples of correctly labelled references.</p>

      right_html: >-
        <h3>3. Save</h3>

        <p><em>That's it!</em> When you've reviewed the segments just click on one of
        the available output formats to convert and save your references.</p>

        <p>But there is more: because AnyStyle is based on machine learning you
        can help us improve! If the parser produces poor results for your
        citation style or language, just use the token editor to correctly
        label a handful of references; when you save the results, we will
        extract your adjustments and use them to train the parser; give
        us a few minutes to crunch numbers and try to parse your references
        again using the updated model: we hope the results will be much improved!</p>

        <p>Pro tip: the current model's timestamp is included at the bottom of
        the parsed results; when training the model, keep an eye on the time
        to see whether or not your training data was already merged into the
        model.</p>

        <p>Please note that we receive a lot of training data; too much or
        inconsistently-labelled data can
        cause the model to deteriorate so we may reset the model from time
        to time. Please let us know if training the model does not work for you
        or if your parse results are poor so we can take a look. Also, if you'd
        be interested in helping us curate the training data, your help is
        much appreciated!</p>

        AnyStyle is open source software and freely available as a RubyGem!
      usage: >-
        After installing the Gem you can start parsing references on your
        own computer directly from Ruby like this:
      more_html:
        The RubyGem also includes a finder module to extract references
        from ful-text PDF documents.<br/>For more details on how to use and train the
        parser and finder, please consult the <a href="%{doc_url}">API documentation</a>.

      We believe that there are better ways to spend your time than to parse
      bibliographies by hand; and isn't it precisely at this sort of tedious
      work that machines are supposed to excel?
      We hope this one will! However, if you find a bug or have an
      idea for improvement that we missed, you're welcome to open an issue
      or feature request.

    right_html: >-
      AnyStyle uses powerful machine learning heuristics based on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field">Conditional Random Fields</a>
      that can be trained by everyone using our built-in editor.
      If you would like to support us, require more advanced adjustments,
      a custom model or want to integrate a similar parser into your own site
      or product, we'll be happy to work with you.
